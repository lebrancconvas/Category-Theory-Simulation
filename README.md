### UI Design

### Plan

- Functional Requirement
  - [ ] Have an editor section and a visual diagram section.
  - [ ] User can write code (TypeScript for the first version) in the editor section.
    - [ ] Automatically Generated or Click to generate?
- Non-Functional Requirement
  - [ ] Have an option to swap editor section and visual diagram section.
  - [ ] R E S P O N S I V E     D E S I G N
  - [ ] P E R F O R M A N C E (like generated time.)

### Tech Stack

- **Front-End**
  - *Programming Language*
    - TypeScript: My Best Language Waifu :P
  - *Framework / Library*
    - NextJS (built with PNPM): I just want to practice NextJS skill so I decided to use it.
    - Monaco Editor: For making an editor.
    - ReactFlow: For making a diagram.
